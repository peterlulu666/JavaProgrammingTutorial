# Directory Lookup Application

## What is the assignment

Write a directory (database) lookup application which operates by

1. reading a list of numbers stored in file Data3.txt to create a database of numbers:
    - The list of numbers is preceded by a number (first number in the list) that specifies the size of the list. 
    - This file name Data3.txt is supplied as a command-line argument to the application.
2. accepting user input (supplied at the keyboard) which are numbers that it checks to see whether or not they are in its database.        

For each number x input by the user the program displays (prints) “x is in the list” or “x is not in the list” depending upon whether or not x is in the list.

The program terminates when the user enters Ctrl-Z (Ctrl-D) on the keyboard.
